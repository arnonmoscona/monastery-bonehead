# monastery-bonehead
A collection of small POCs for the monastery-api interfaces.
Since interfaces cannot have real tests on their own, while they are being formulated, the POC code creates dummy implementations that exercize the flows that the interfaces are supposed to participate in. The objective is to test out whether the API is simple and usable enough for the imagined use cases.
